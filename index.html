  <h2>Pro Tips: Mastering the Art of High School Drama</h2>
            </div>
        
  <p>Now that you’ve made it through the ups and downs of high school survival, here are some final <b>Pro Tips</b> to keep you ahead of the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Group Projects</b>: Befriend “The Perfectionist” early. Trust me, they're your ticket to getting things done. Of course nothing is free in life, so maybe give them some incentive via chips or sweets!</li>
    <li><b>Hallway Traffic Jams</b>: Try to walk in the corners, next to the lockers. And if you meet the slow walkers, don't be afraid to give them a push! (this is a joke obviously) </li>
    <li><b>Decoding Teacher Lingo</b>: When your teacher says, “This will be on the test” = Just study everything..</li>
    <li><b>Awkward Small Talk</b>: If all else fails, just smile, nod, and ask about homework. :)</li>
    <li><b>School Lunch</b>: Always have backup snacks. If the pizza looks questionable, pull out your own stuff. At least you won't question if the meat is real or not.</li>
    <li><b>Crush Moments</b>: We all know the feeling of having a crush. What's the way to deal with them? Don't have one, problem solved.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>High school can be a little crazy, but with these tips, you'll be just fine. Remember, highschool is NOT supposed to be perfect. Live and Learn. But most importantly, HAVE FUN!!</p>
