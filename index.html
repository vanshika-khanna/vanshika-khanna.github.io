  <h2>Pro Tips: Mastering the Art of High School Drama</h2>
  <p>Now that you’ve made it through the ups and downs of high school survival, here are some final <b>Pro Tips</b> to keep you ahead of the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Group Projects</b>: Befriend “The Perfectionist” early—they’re your ticket to getting things done. And maybe offer “The Free Rider” some extra snacks in exchange for effort!</li>
    <li><b>Hallway Traffic Jams</b>: Walk with purpose. Channel your inner hallway ninja to weave through “The Slow Walkers” and dodge “The Backpack Swingers.”</li>
    <li><b>Decoding Teacher Lingo</b>: When your teacher says, “This will be on the test,” just study everything… or at least have a panic playlist ready.</li>
    <li><b>Awkward Small Talk</b>: Keep it simple. If all else fails, just smile, nod, and ask about the homework.</li>
    <li><b>School Lunch</b>: Always pack backup snacks. If the pizza looks like cardboard and the veggies look suspicious, pull out your chips and candy stash—you’ll thank yourself later.</li>
    <li><b>Crush Moments</b>: Stay cool, even when you trip. Confidence is key—because what’s more charming than a good sense of humor after an embarrassing wave mix-up?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>High school can be a wild ride, but with these tips (and a little humor), you’ll navigate the chaos like a pro!</p>

    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun &amp; incredibly overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you’ll have an unforgettable experience!” </p> 
    <h2>Getting Tickets &amp; Picking the Shows</h2> 
    <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg"/>
    <p> If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p> 
    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2> 
    <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-three.jpeg"/>
    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
